# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
<p>
This is a Python program which visualizes the sorting process for many various sorting algorithms.
I've also implemented the max heap data structure in order to include heap sort.
</p>
<b>Note:</b> 
<p>
I programmed these algorithms when I was young and naive, and hadn't yet taken an actual
data structures and algorithms class. Eventually, I learned some ways that we could optimize these
sorts, and am planning to apply those optimizations later. For example, heap sort can be done in-place(so,
there would be no need for the separate heap structure). Another optimization would be, for quick sort, making
a smarter choice for the pivot instead of blindly picking the first element of the partitioned piece to be the pivot.
</p>

The sorting algorithms included are:
<h2>O(nlogn) sorts:</h2>
<p><h3>Quick sort</h3></p>
<p><h3>Merge sort</h3></p>
<p><h3>Heap sort</h3></p>
<h2>O(n^2) sorts:</h2>
<p><h3>Bubble sort</h3></p>
<p><h3>Insertion sort</h3></p>
<p><h3>Selection sort</h3></p>
<h2>O(Infinity??)</h2>
<p><h3>BOGO SORT(the best one! :( not really)</h3></P>
