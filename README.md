# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
Python program which visualizes the sorting process for many various sorting algorithms.
I've also implemented the max heap data structure in order to include heap sort. Note that 
this project was created before I realized that heap sort could be done in-place lol.
The sorting algorithms included are:
<h2>O(nlogn) sorts:</h2>
<p><h3>Quick sort</h3></p>
<p><h3>Merge sort</h3></p>
<p><h3>Heap sort</h3></p>
<h2>O(n^2) sorts:</h2>
<p><h3>Bubble sort</h3></p>
<p><h3>Insertion sort</h3></p>
<p><h3>Selection sort</h3></p>
<h2>O(Infinity??)</h2>
<p><h3>BOGO SORT(the best one! :( not really)</h3></P>
