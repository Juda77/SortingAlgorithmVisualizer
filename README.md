# SortingAlgorithmVisualizer
Python program which visualizes the sorting process for many various sorting algorithms, including:
bubble sort,
insertion sort,
selection sort,
quick sort,
merge sort, 
heap sort,
and BOGO SORT(the best one!)
This project was inspired by Clement Mihailescu's sorting algorithm visualizer, as seen here: https://youtu.be/n4t_-NjY_Sg?t=521
